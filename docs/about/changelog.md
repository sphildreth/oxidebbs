## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added the initial Rust workspace scaffold with focused crates for server,
  core, terminal, telnet, database, door, and sysop boundaries.
- Added native DecentDB Rust dependency wiring through the released
  `sphildreth/decentdb` `v2.8.0` Git tag, without requiring a local DecentDB
  checkout.
- Added a minimal `oxidebbs-db` wrapper that opens DecentDB, initializes the
  starter schema, and records an OxideBBS schema-version marker.
- Added initial ANSI/CP437 terminal helpers with tests for box-drawing
  conversion, unrepresentable-character errors, and ANSI escape byte output.
- Added 40-column and 80-column terminal profile requirements to the product and
  technical design documents.
- Added VitePress documentation under `docs/`, including GitHub Pages deployment
  support for `https://oxidebbs.com`.
- Added GitHub Actions CI for Rust checks and documentation builds.
- Added the first configurable menu model, safe key-to-action routing, login and
  main menu config, terminal-capability screen selection, and starter
  `assets/screens/` layout.
- Added terminal screen asset loading, plain-text fallback rendering,
  width-aware menu/status/pager helpers, telnet IAC negotiation parsing,
  terminal type and NAWS events, core user/login/message flows, door drop-file
  generation and runners, DecentDB message/session/door repositories, sysop
  admin commands, and FTN/OxideNet domain models.
- Added an interactive `oxidebbs-server setup` command that writes a starter
  board config, prepares local directories, and can include a placeholder door
  definition without bundling door binaries.
- Added the first real `oxidebbs-server serve` runtime with a telnet listener,
  node-slot allocation, DecentDB session/audit records, configured screen
  rendering, starter menu routing, NAWS width updates, idle timeout handling,
  and placeholder responses for auth, messages, and doors.

### Changed

- Reworked the starter DecentDB schema to use native `UUID`, `TIMESTAMPTZ`,
  `IPADDR`, and `BOOL` columns, plus foreign keys, CHECK constraints, and
  relationship indexes.
- Normalized example door definitions under `[[doors.definitions]]` so door
  settings and door entries share one config namespace without table collisions.
- Updated repository documentation to point at the `design/` document tree and
  the VitePress docs site.
- Updated development checks to use the committed lockfile with Cargo
  `--locked`.

### Fixed

- Added a starter `logoff.ans` asset so the example config references existing
  bundled ANSI files.
