# DecentDB Versioning Guide

This guide defines how DecentDB version jumps work and which files must be
updated when the project version changes.

## 1. Versioning policy

DecentDB uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html):

- **Major (`X.0.0`)** for breaking changes to public APIs, the on-disk format, binding behavior, or other compatibility boundaries.
- **Minor (`X.Y.0`)** for backwards-compatible feature additions.
- **Patch (`X.Y.Z`)** for backwards-compatible fixes, packaging adjustments, CI fixes, and documentation updates that do not change the public contract.

### Choosing the bump when a branch has mixed changes

Pick the **highest-impact** change class in the branch:

1. Any breaking compatibility change => **Major**
2. Otherwise, any new user-visible capability => **Minor**
3. Otherwise (fixes/tooling/docs only) => **Patch**

Examples:
- Feature + bug fix in one branch => **Minor** (not Patch)
- Docs + CI + packaging only => **Patch**

### Public release line

The current public DecentDB release line begins at `v2.0.0`.

## 2. Source of truth

The repository root `VERSION` file is the canonical DecentDB release version.

When DecentDB's release version changes:

1. update `VERSION`
2. run `scripts/bump_version.sh`
3. refresh binding lockfiles / generated metadata where needed

The bump script propagates the version into the release-facing metadata that
exists in the Rust repository today.

### Core Rust workspace

- `VERSION`
- `Cargo.toml`  
  Update `[workspace.package].version`. The Rust crates inherit from the workspace version.

### Python binding

- `bindings/python/pyproject.toml`  
  Update `[project].version`.

### Java / DBeaver

- `bindings/java/driver/build.gradle`
- `bindings/java/driver/src/main/java/com/decentdb/jdbc/DecentDBDriver.java`
- `bindings/java/dbeaver-extension/build.gradle`
- `bindings/java/dbeaver-extension/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`

### Dart binding

- `bindings/dart/dart/pubspec.yaml`  
  Update `version`.
- `bindings/dart/flutter/pubspec.yaml`  
  Update `version` when the Flutter mobile package is released from this
  repository. If it uses a local path dependency on `decentdb` during
  development, release packaging must swap or validate that dependency before
  publishing.
- `bindings/dart/flutter/android/build.gradle`
- `bindings/dart/flutter/ios/decentdb_flutter.podspec`
- `bindings/dart/flutter/example/pubspec.yaml`
  The checked-in Flutter reference app follows the mobile package release line
  because it is used by release artifact validation.
- Dart `pubspec.lock` files that pin local `path` dependencies on `decentdb` or
  `decentdb_flutter`
  Refresh only the local path package versions; do not rewrite hosted
  dependency versions such as `args`.

### Node bindings

- `bindings/node/decentdb/package.json`
- `bindings/node/decentdb/package-lock.json`
- `bindings/node/knex-decentdb/package.json`
- `bindings/node/knex-decentdb/package-lock.json`

For the Node packages, update both the manifest and the lockfile's top-level package version entries.

### Documentation

- `docs/about/changelog.md`  
  Add or update release notes under `Unreleased` or under the new version heading, depending on the release process being used.
- `docs/user-guide/benchmarks.md`
  Update the DecentDB engine version stamp when the workspace release version
  changes.
- `design/FUTURE_WINS.md`
  Update the current public release marker that defines the `vNext` planning
  bucket. Historical delivered-context references stay unchanged.

### Secondary lockfiles

- `benchmarks/rust-baseline/Cargo.lock`
  Update only the local workspace path package versions for `decentdb` and
  `libpg_query_sys`; leave third-party crate versions untouched.

### Release automation

- `.github/workflows/nuget.yml`  
  The .NET/NuGet packages do **not** hard-code their package versions in the `.csproj` files. CI derives them from Git tags in the format:
  - `vX.Y.Z`
  - `vX.Y.Z-rc.N`

## 3. Files that usually do **not** need a version bump

Do **not** bump unrelated example/demo app versions just to match the DecentDB
release unless they explicitly surface the shipped DecentDB version to users or
participate in release artifact validation.

Examples:

- `bindings/dart/examples/**/pubspec.yaml`
- dependency versions inside `package-lock.json`

Those files may contain version numbers, but they are not automatically part of
the DecentDB release version.

Exception: if an example uses a local path dependency on the DecentDB package,
refreshing its lockfile may be appropriate so the locked package version matches
the current release line.

## 4. Recommended version-bump procedure

1. Decide the next version according to SemVer (using the highest-impact rule above).
2. Update `VERSION`.
3. Run `scripts/bump_version.sh`.
4. Update `docs/about/changelog.md`.
5. Refresh Node lockfiles and any example lockfiles that pin the local DecentDB package.
6. Re-scan the repository for stale release-version strings.
7. Validate that package metadata still parses and that lockfiles stayed aligned.
8. Create the release tag when the project is ready to publish.

## 5. Node-specific procedure

After running `scripts/bump_version.sh`, refresh Node lockfiles with npm
instead of hand-editing them.

`scripts/bump_version.sh` already updates both Node `package.json` version
fields, so the normal follow-up is lockfile refresh only.

```bash
cd bindings/node/decentdb
npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts

cd ../knex-decentdb
npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts
```

This refreshes lockfile metadata (including the local `file:../decentdb`
dependency in `knex-decentdb`) after the underlying package version changes.

## 6. Validation checklist

After a version bump, verify:

- `VERSION` and `Cargo.toml` have the intended workspace version.
- Python, Java, Dart, and Node package metadata all reflect the same DecentDB release version.
- `docs/about/changelog.md` explains the release and any important versioning context.
- No stale old-version references remain in the release-facing files.
- The NuGet workflow still matches the current tag format.

Useful commands:

```bash
cargo metadata --no-deps --format-version 1 >/dev/null

rg 'OLD_VERSION|vOLD_VERSION' \
  VERSION \
  Cargo.toml \
  bindings/python/pyproject.toml \
  bindings/java/driver/build.gradle \
  bindings/java/driver/src/main/java/com/decentdb/jdbc/DecentDBDriver.java \
  bindings/java/dbeaver-extension/build.gradle \
  bindings/java/dbeaver-extension/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF \
  bindings/dart/dart/pubspec.yaml \
  bindings/dart/flutter/pubspec.yaml \
  bindings/dart/flutter/android/build.gradle \
  bindings/dart/flutter/ios/decentdb_flutter.podspec \
  bindings/dart/flutter/example/pubspec.yaml \
  bindings/dart/flutter/pubspec.lock \
  bindings/dart/flutter/example/pubspec.lock \
  bindings/dart/examples/console/pubspec.lock \
  bindings/dart/examples/console_complex/pubspec.lock \
  bindings/dart/examples/flutter_desktop/pubspec.lock \
  tests/bindings/dart/pubspec.lock \
  bindings/node/decentdb/package.json \
  bindings/node/decentdb/package-lock.json \
  bindings/node/knex-decentdb/package.json \
  bindings/node/knex-decentdb/package-lock.json \
  benchmarks/rust-baseline/Cargo.lock \
  docs/about/changelog.md \
  docs/user-guide/benchmarks.md \
  design/FUTURE_WINS.md \
  .github/workflows/nuget.yml
```

Replace `OLD_VERSION` with the version you are replacing.

## 7. Release tag rules

When publishing, use Git tags with a leading `v`:

- Stable release: `v2.0.0`
- Release candidate: `v2.1.0-rc.1`

The current NuGet workflow converts those tags into package versions without the leading `v`.
